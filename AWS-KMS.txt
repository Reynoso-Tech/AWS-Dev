KMS - Key Management Service
	- Managed service that helps create & control keys used to encrypt data
	- Integrated with many AWS services

CMK - Customer Master Key
	- Encrypt/decrypt data up to 4KB
	- CMK is used to encrypt/decrypt the Data Key.
	- Data Key used to encrypt/decrypt your data
	- Known as Envelope Encryption (A key de/encrypts another key that de/encrypts actual data)

Key types:
	- Symmetric - single key used for de/encrypt ops
	- Asymmetric - a public + private key pair that can be used for de/encrypt ops or sign/verify ops


Key material origins:
	- KMS - default
	- External - provide your own 
	- Custom key store(CloudHSM) - dedicated single tenant hardware, for compliance


An alias is created with CMK to refer to key instead of key ID

Key administrators - IAM users or roles selected to allow use of KMS api to admin this key

Key usage permissions - IAM users or roles that can use this key to de/encrypt data using api

If you delete a key it isn't deleted right away, it is scheduled for a week later. Allows you to cancel

KMS console shows AWS managed keys for services you use as well, CMK is under customer managed keys

KMS API Calls - If user or role was defined in key usage permission
	- aws kms encrypt 
		- encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a CMK
	- aws kms decrypt
		- decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted using KMS
	- aws kms re-encrypt
		- decrypts ciphertext then re-encrypts it entirely within AWS KMS (for changing the CMK or manual rotation)
	- aws kms enable-key-rotation
		- enables automatic key rotation once per year
	- aws kms generate-data-key
		- uses CMK to generate a data key to encrypt data > 4KB
		- returns encrypted data key, KMS does not store data key
		- to use data key, KMS is sent the encrypted data key
			- KMS returns decrypted data key
				- decrypted data key used to de/encrypt data > 4KB
