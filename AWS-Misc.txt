AWS CLI Pagination:

default page size is 1,000 items

--page-size x (will return x number of items per api call, still retrieves all items, just makes more calls)
--max-items x (will limit items returned to x)

Roles allow you not to use access keys on ec2 instances
Roles are preferred from a security perspective
Role controlled by policy
Policy change on role takes immediate effect
Roles can attach & detach from running ec2 instances 


AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:

Under Systems Manager service in AWS
Under App Management - Parameter Store

Type can be String, StringList, or SecureString
SecureString encrypted using KMS 
Good for confidential info like passwords, DB connection strings, & license codes.
Can store as plain text or encrypted
Parameter can be accessed by EC2, CloudFormation, Lambda, EC2 Run Command

Route 53:

An AWS DNS service
Allows you to map domain names to EC2 instances, ELBs, or S3 buckets

Hosted zone to manage records

CloudFront:

CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a system of distributed servers that provide content to a user based on the geolocation of the user. Helps speed up delivery when users are in different geolocations.
CloudFront is focused on content delivery, more efficient reads & downloads
Reduces amount of network hops 

Edge Location - Is where the content is cached & can also be written. Separate to an AWS Region/AZ. Multiple edge locations can be in 1 AZ 
Origin - Origin of files the CDN distributes, can be an S3 bucket, EC2 instance, ELB, or R53

Distribution - Name given to the CDN, consists of a collection of edge locations

Types of Distribution 
Web Distribution - normally used for Websites (HTTP/HTTPS)
RTMP - Used for media streaming

Objects are cleared from cache after TTL expires
Can restrict view access with Signed URLs or Signed Cookies (for websites with paid content)
Offers WAF (web application firewall, protects against application attacks) 
Offers geo-restrictions, can white list or black list requests from certain countries 
Cache can be cleared by invalidated objects

Messaging Services:

SQS - Message Queue service
Helps decouple application components 
Messages are not deleted until successfully processed
Messages can contain up to 256 KB of text in any format 
Messages are retrieved using SQS API 
Pull-Based
Messages can be kept in queue for up to 14 days, default is 4 days 

SQS Queue types 
    - Standard queue, default, best effort ordering
        - Nearly-unlimited number of transactions per second
    - FIFO queue, first in first out, strict ordering 
        - Exactly once processing, message available until processed or deleted
        - 300 transactions per second limit 

Visibility Timeout - the amount of time a message is invisible in queue after it is read
    - 30 seconds by default
    - If message processed okay it should be deleted before visibility timeout
    - If message not deleted before timeout it will be available in queue again 
    - If messages normally take over 30 seconds to process change timeout, max is 12 hours

Short Polling - Returns response immediately, even if queue is empty
    - Can result in lots of empty reponses
    - Costs rise with extra responses 
Long Polling - Periodically polls queue
    - Doesn't return a response until a message arrives or long poll times out
    - Can save money, long polling is generally perferable to short polling

SQS Delay Queues - postpone delivery of new messages
    - Messages sent to delay queue are invisible for duration of delay period 
    - Default delay is 0 seconds, max is 900 
    - If delay period changed
        - In standard queue it doesn't affect messages already in queue
        - In FIFO queue it affects messages in queue

For large messages (over 256KB, up to 2GB) use S3 to store messages
Amazon SQS Extended Client Library (along with aws-sdk) used to manage those messages in S3

SNS - Notification Service 
Messages are immediately delivered to subscriptions 
Push based 
Use pub-sub model (publish & subscribe)
App publishes to SNS topic, confirmed subscribers to topic will recieve the message

SES - Email Service
Scalable, highly available email 
Can send & receive emails to an S3 bucket
Can trigger Lambda & SNS 


Kinesis - services that enable you to collect, process & analyze streaming data

    - Kinesis streams - Allows you to build custom applications that process data in real-time, Data streams or video streams
        - Kinesis shards - The Kinesis stream is made up of shards
            - Each shard is a sequence of 1 or more data records, capacity controlled by number of shards
            - Each shard has 5 reads per second, with max read rate 2MB per second
            - Each shard has 1,000 writes per second, with max write rate 1MB per second
            - Add more shards to increase capacity 
            - Default retention 24 hours, up to 7 days 
    - Kinesis Data Firehose - Allows you to capture, transform, load data streams into AWS data stores
        - to enable near-real-time analytics with BI tools
        - no shards or streams
        - optionally can use a lambda to process data real-time when it comes to Firehose
        - no data retention, sends data straight to perm storage (S3, Elasticsearch)
    - Kinesis Data Analytics - Analyze, query, & transform streamed data in real-time using SQL
        - Allows you to run SQL queries on data as it leaves data firehose or streams
        - Data returned from query can be stored in S3, elasticsearch, redshift
