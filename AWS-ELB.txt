	- Best suited for balancing HTTP & HTTPS traffic
	- Operates at layer 7, application aware, for advanced request routing 
Network Load Balancer - Operates at layer 4 
	- Best suited for balancing TCP traffic for fast performance
	- Can handle millions of requests with ultra-low latency 
Classic Load Balancer - Legacy LB
	- Can load balance HTTP/HTTPS & use layer 7 features, like X-Forwarded & sticky sessions
	- Can load balance TCP for strict layer 4 LB
	- Recommended to use ALB or NLB instead
