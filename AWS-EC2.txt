Like a VM, but hosted by AWS instead of in your own data center

Reserved capacity 
	- Instances are region specific. About <= 70% discount for committing to instance for 1 or 3 years.
	- Predictable usage
	- Specific capacity requirements 
	- Discount for paying up front 
	Standard 
		- Cannot change during term
	Convertible 
		- Has option to change to instances of equal or greater value
	Scheduled 
		- Launches reservation during a predictable recurring schedule
On demand 
	- Pay by the hour or second of instance run time
	- Flexible
	- Short-term
Spot 
	- Purchases unused capacity at huge discount, performance & price fluctuates
	- Set a max price you are willing to pay, unused capacity price raises as supply drops, if price exceeds your max price your instance will stop until price drops again

Dedicated 
	- Buy a physical EC2 server for yourself. Most expensive, useful for compliance or licensing issues with multi tenant hardware
	- On-demand or reserved - Hourly or discounted with commitment

Instance types - determines the hardware of the machine running instance. Select based on application requirements 

AMI - Amazon Machine Image - OS that instance will run on boot 

EBS - Elastic Block Store - Storage you can attach to an EC2 instance
	- At least 1 EBS vol on all EC2 instances (for root), Seen as a normal system disk to OS
	- Good for prod, Highly available, automatically replicated in availability zone to protect against hardware fail
	- Dynamic increase & change vol with no downtime or impact 

General Purpose SSD (gp2, gp3)
	- Balanced price & performance 
	- 3 IOPS per GB of storage, up to max of 16k IOPS per vol
	- If < 1TB can burst up to 3k IOPS using IO credits 

Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1, io2)
	- Optimized IOPS performance
	- 50 IOPS per GB of storage, up to 64k IOPS per vol
	- “io2” has 500 IOPS per GB, still up to 64k max
	- “io2” has 5 9s availability 
	- Use if more than 16k IOPS needed 

Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
	- 40 MB/s per TB
	- Can burst up to 250 MB/s per TB, max of 500 MB/s per vol
	- Low cost HDD vol for Big data, ETL, & log processing
	- CANNOT be a boot vol 

Cold HDD (sc1)
	- 12 MB/s per TB
	- Can burst up to 80 MB/s, max of 250 MB/s per vol
